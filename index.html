                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m a third-year undergraduate studying Applied Math, Machine Learning, and Data Science at Northwestern University. My primary interest lies in AI research, spanning anything from Computer Vision to Robotics to Reinforcement Learning. 
                    <br><br>
                    I enjoy exploration in any form like getting out into nature, travelling, trying new strategies on the tennis court, and learning something new. It is this same exploratory mindset that I intend to apply to solving problems by finding creative solutions.
